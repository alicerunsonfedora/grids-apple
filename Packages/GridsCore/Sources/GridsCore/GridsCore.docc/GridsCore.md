Utilize shared components and logic for the Grids app across platforms.

## Overview

The Grids Core Library (`GridsCore`) contains shared logic, views, services, and more to be used across macOS, iOS, and
iPadOS.

Ideally, this can be used to create a singular multiplatform app. However, the core library offers all the necessary
components to make versions of the Grids app that are finely tuned to each applicable platform.
